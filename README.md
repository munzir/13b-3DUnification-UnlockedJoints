## Setup

- DART
 [Dart Homepage](https://dartsim.github.io)

- config4cpp
 [Source Code Download](http://www.config4star.org/#main-source-code)

 How to add config4cpp to your system (Linux/BSD/OSX)

  1: Download and extract the source code of config4cpp

  2: cd config4cpp

  3: Follow the README.txt in config4cpp/

  4: Run the following commands to add the make'd files into your local system

    sudo cp bin/{config2cpp,config4cpp} /usr/local/bin &&
    sudo cp lib/libconfig4cpp.a /usr/local/lib &&
    sudo cp -r include/config4cpp /usr/local/include &&
    sudo chmod g+rx /usr/local/include/config4cpp &&
    sudo chmod o+rx /usr/local/include/config4cpp

  \*Note: You can just copy paste the above block of commands

- [09-URDF](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/09-URDF)
 Install the repository.

- Install [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)

## Use
Before compiling the code, specify the path to your local copy of repo 09-URDF in the "urdfpath" entry of the configuration file located at examples/3dofddp/controlParams.cfg. In the same file, there are many other configuration parameters that the user can play with. For now, their meaning will need to be understood by looking at their role in the source code itself.

To compile:

    rm -r build
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

To run:

    cd examples/3dofddp
    ./3dofddp
