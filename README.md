## Use
In `src/controlParams.cfg`, there are many configuration parameters that the user can play with. For now, their meaning will need to be understood by looking at their role in the source code itself.

To compile:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

To run:

    cd src/
    ./3dofddp
